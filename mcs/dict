UOPYRIGHT 1S83-1886, 1898, 

BY SAMUEL FALLOWS. 



This work is designed to aid students, literary men, public 
speakers and others, in finding the best word to express the 
thought they wish to convey. 

The author believes that the Antonyms will be of as great 
assistance in furnishing words of opposite meaning as the 
Synonyms in supplying synonymous words. 

The special works of Roget, Soule, Skeats, Campbell, 
Archdeacon Smith, etc., and the various standard dic- 
tionaries, have been laid under contribution for this work. 

For the solution of -Cross Word Puzzles special attention 
is called also to the lists of Americanisms and Briticisms and 
the immensely valuable table of Homonyms (words spelt 
alike but differing in use) original features of easily 
recognized importance.

friends." ''Pamphlets were found 
among the books." We may say 
among the schoolmen; among the 
philosophers, among the Americans, 
among the Orientals, among the ideas 
advanced, among the arguments 
used. In none of these cases could 
amid, or amidst, be used. So we may 
say amidst temptations, amidst suffer- 
ings, amidst difficulties, amidst the 
waves. Amotiy, or amongst, could 
not be used in these cases. Wheu the 
idea of quantity is conveyed, or can 
be considered, amidst is generally 
used. Hence, we can say, "Apples 
gleaming rosy-red amidst the leaves." 
If the idea of number Is conveyed 
we should use amongst. 
Milton says of the seraph Abdiel : 

"Faithful found 
Among the faithless, faithful only he," 

because he had been one of the num- 
ber of the rebellious host before 
they had fallen, and was yet inter- 
mingled with them. But when he 
determined to leave them, Milton 
discriminatingly adds 

" From amidst them forth he passed."

used interchange- 



To stand around, or round. To 
throw his eyes around, or round. 
To travel around. To send invita- 
tions round. To rally round the 
flag. To join hands round the tree. 
Round is perhaps more frequently 
used than around. All round means 
in every direction j over the whole 
place. 

at ) While these two words both Indi- 
toy J oate nearness, at is more spe- 



cific than by, giving the Idea of a 
customary, or particular nearness. 

" He stood at the entrance " would 
mean more than " He stood by it," 
the one indicating the closest prox- 
imity in front, the other in the 
neighborhood of it, or near to it. 

" They sit at the table " differs 
from "They sit by the table." The 
first means they face the table, the 
second does not. 

at / At is less definite than in. At the 
In ) church may mean in, or near the 
church. Hence, at does not make a 
reference to the interior prominent. 
It is proper to use at before the 
names of small towns, villages, for- 
eign cities far remote, and houses ; 
as, He lived at Fishkill, lectured at 
Winnebago, died at Pekin. 

In should be used before the 
names of the great geographical, 
or political divisions of the globe, 
countries, and large cities; as, He 
teaches in Paris. She sings in New 
York. At should be used before the 
number of a street, and in (not on) 
before the name of the street ; as. 
The officer was found at the Court 
House in Clark street. 

At or in may often be used inter- 
changeably ; as, He was crowned in, 
or at Paris. Both at Belfast and in 
Dublin riots occurred. 

At is used after the verb TOUCH ; 
as, The vessel touched at Queens- 
town. At or in may be used after 
the verb ARRIVE; as, They arrived 
at, or in Liverpool. At or in may 
be used after the verb TO BE; as, 
He has been at Boston, in Balti- 
more. 

beside ) These words are inter- 
besides \ changeable in the mean- 
ings of ''over and above," " distinct 
from," although besides is more fre- 
quently used in this sense ; as, 

There were learned men besides 
these." Beside means, " By, or at 
the side of," " on one side of" ; as, 
"He sat beside me." Also, "aside 
from," "apart from," or "out of;" 
as, " Paul, thou art beside thyself." 

Besides specially means, " more- 
over," " in addition to " ; as, " There 
were other nations besides these." 

NOT*. Skeats contends that the

use of besides as a preposition, 
which is a later development of be- 
tide, is, strictly, incorrect, but is as 
old as the twelfth century. 

but ~) These words are almost 

besides I all used in nearly the 
except V same sense. Excepting 
save I is the game as except, 

without ' but not so often used. 

Save Is generally used in poetry. 

He could do nothing but for me, is 

the same as he could do nothing 

without me. 

NOTE. Skeats very properly gives 
the synonym without. Webster and 
Worcester omit it. 

by "1 By and beside are sometimes 

beside 1 interchangeable. He sat 

near [" by me, or beside me. These 

on J terms indicate a little 

more closeness 'of proximity than 

the word near. 

By and on are often interchange- 
able; as, By land and by water, or 
on land and on water they engage in 
the fight. 

by ") Whenever n conscious 

\v i tli !- agent is mentioned, and 

through i the instrument employed 

to accomplish his purpose, by must 

be used to denote the agent, and 

with, in general, the instrument ; as, 

" He was slain by his enemy with the 

sword." 

Thus, by denotes in general the es- 
sential or immediate agent, and 
with, carrying the idea of companion- 
ship, the means or instrument em- 
ployed by the agent. 

He was struck by the sun. The 
sun struck him with its rays. The 
tree was shaken by the wind. The 
wind shook the tree with its strong 
hand. 

The city was destroyed by fire. 
Here fire is the essential agent. 

He destroyed the city with flre. 
Here fire is the auxiliary means or 
instrument. 

By attention and prompt action he 
won his case, these being the essen- 
tial agents of success. 

He won his case through attention 
and prompt action, these being the 
Important auxiliaries.

out of) able as denoting origin,

into. After a verb of motion it has 
the meaning of forth from. He went 
out of the house. He was driven 
from, or out of the country. He 
leaped from, or out o/the carriage. 
from I From is sometimes inter- 
of f changeable with of, not as 
often as formerly. 

We may say, " To be rid of these 
question able characters." 'Til rid 
you from further fear concerning 
tneia."

thprs there is no distinction between 
the words. 

" Smiteth of my bed, is equivalent 
to " smite off my head." Chaucer.

" The old, old story was told again 
at five o'clock in the morning. " 

"At nine o clock on the morning

be used and not in. 

He went info the hall. She rode

with their friends in Central Park.

He was led by evidence into a be- 
lief of the truth. The manuscripts

In is often used for *nto when the

out, i. e., in office, or out 01 -jftice. 
Come in, i. e., come into the house. 
The ship has come in, i. e., come

than in. 

in ) We say he went on the steam'

he rode in the cars. 

We also eay, " He read the first 
line in the page " (preferable to on 
the page). He paid seventy cents in 
the dollar, or on the dollar ; four 
shillings in, or on the pound. Eng- 
lish usage is in the pound ; as, " Sir 
shillings in the pound." 

in ) In a few cases these words 

within ) are interchangeable. With- 
in, however, is more emphatic than 
in. 

We may say within the range of his 
influence, or in the range etc. ; with- 
in his power, or in his power ; urithin 
ten minutes, or in ten minutes. 

In my Father's house are many man- 
sions. John xiv. 2. 

In cases like the following, how- 
ever, within does not mean the same

within his grasp. It was in his 
grasp. In the first instance it may 
simply mean it was in the limits, or 
compass of his grasp ; in the other 
instance it would mean that it was 
actually in his grasp. 

Within means "in the inner or 
interior part ; " " inside of ; " "with-

on ) Are interchangeable words. 

upon J Sometimes on account of 
elegance or euphony, upon is the 
more preferable word. Generally, 
however, on is now used in place of 
upon. We may say, Play on, or 
upon the harp, the piano, the violin, 
the drum, etc. On would be chosen, 
as a rule. 

On is omitted before the words 
" to-day ;" " to-morrow ; " " yester- 
day ;" " last evening ; " " this mor-
